Fix My Mistakes is a simple approach to the age-old obstacle of grammatical errors in writing. While common grammar lessons and exercises may appear tedious and daunting, Fix My Mistakes aims to motivate and improve the user's literary capabilities. Users are tasked with correcting grammatically-faulty text in exchange for experience points based on their correction accuracy. Once enough experience points are obtained by the player, they are able to "level up", thereby increasing their rank on the Fix My Mistakes platform.

User progress is logged and stored via an account defined by an email and a password. Users who are not logged in my attempt the exercises, but will not be able to gain any progress. Only by using the designated login page in Fix My Mistakes will the user be able to start or resume their writing journey.
